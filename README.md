This project aims to create an extended lavalink api that can runs on kubernetes.
This made us use a microservices infrastructure.
Since lavalink protocol is based on Websocket & Http requests, we need to implement the old protocol.
Some extended lavalink protocol is available.


## `Why this project ðŸ¤“ ?`

This project try to solve this problem : \
**`How can i use loadbalancing with my lavalink with implementing it on the client site with client discovery ?`**

## `System documentation`

The documentation is available in two parts, the external LavaLink API documentation, the LavaPod extended API methods & the LavaPod internal API.
Since this projects implements the LavaLink API. We still need to include the old LavaLink API.
